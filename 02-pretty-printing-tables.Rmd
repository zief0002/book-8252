# Pretty-Printing Tables in Markdown {-}

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)

opts_knit$set(
  width = 85, 
  tibble.print_max = Inf
  )

opts_chunk$set(
  prompt = FALSE, 
  comment = NA, 
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy = FALSE, 
  fig.align = 'center',
  out.width = '50%'
  )
```

Often it is useful to format table output to make it look good or to adhere a particular style (e.g., APA). There are several packages that help in this endeavor when working in an Rmarkdown document. Below the primary tools used are:

- The `kable()` function from the **knitr** package; and 
- Functions from the **kableExtra** package.

Other packages for formatting tables, among others, include the [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/), the [huxtable package](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/), and the [expss package](https://gdemin.github.io/expss/). For complete APA formatting check out the [papaja package](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/).


The primary input to the `kable()` function is a data frame. This data frame will include the primary contents for you table. A data frame can either be created as the ouput of a function or directly using the `data.frame()` function. Below I will create and format a couple different common tables produced for statistical reports. To do so, I will use data from *ed-schools-2018.csv* file (see the [data codebook](#ed-schools-2018) here). These data include institutional-level attributes for several graduate education schools/programs rated by *U.S. News and World Report* in 2018.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(AICcmodavg)
library(broom)
library(corrr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)

# Read in data
ed = read_csv(file = "~/Documents/github/epsy-8252/data/ed-schools-2018.csv")

# Drop rows with missing data
educ = ed %>%
  drop_na()

# Create log-transformed variables
educ = educ %>%
  mutate(
    Lpeer = log(peer),
    Ldoc_accept = log(doc_accept),
    Lenroll = log(enroll)
    )
```

## Summary Statistics Table

Say we wanted to produce a table of means and standard deviations for the variables: `peer`, `doc_accept`, and `enroll`. Furthermore, we want these for both the raw (untransformed) and log-transformed versions of these variables. Here is a sketch of what the table should look like:


[INSERT SKETCH]

To begin we will set up a data frame that includes the information from the table. We do this manually to illustrate  use of the `data.frame()` function to set up a data frame.

```{r echo=FALSE}
tab_01 = data.frame(
  Measure = c("Peer rating", "Ph.D. acceptance rate", "Enrollment"),
  M_1  = c(mean(educ$peer), mean(educ$doc_accept), mean(educ$enroll)),
  SD_1 = c(sd(educ$peer), sd(educ$doc_accept), sd(educ$enroll)),
  M_2  = c(mean(educ$Lpeer), mean(educ$Ldoc_accept), mean(educ$Lenroll)),
  SD_2 = c(sd(educ$Lpeer), sd(educ$Ldoc_accept), sd(educ$Lenroll))
)
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
tab_01 = data.frame(
  Measure = c("Peer rating", "Ph.D. acceptance rate", "Enrollment"),
  M_1  = c(mean(educ$peer), mean(educ$doc_accept), mean(educ$enroll)),
  SD_1 = c(sd(educ$peer), sd(educ$doc_accept), sd(educ$enroll)),
  M_2  = c(mean(educ$Lpeer), mean(educ$Ldoc_accept), mean(educ$Lenroll)),
  SD_2 = c(sd(educ$Lpeer), sd(educ$Ldoc_accept), sd(educ$Lenroll))
)

tab_01
```

```
                Measure        M_1        SD_1      M_2      SD_2
1           Peer rating   3.312295   0.4893203 1.187198 0.1439847
2 Ph.D. acceptance rate  40.113115  20.2276300 3.525419 0.6461164
3            Enrollment 969.762295 664.9454219 6.657939 0.7228670
```


We can now use the `kable()` function to rename the columns, round the numeric values, and set a caption.

```{r}
kable(
  tab_01,
  col.names = c("Measure", "*M*", "*SD*", "*M*", "*SD*"),
  digits = 2,
  caption = "Means and Standard Deviations of Three Measures of Graduate Programs of Education ($n=122$)"
  )
```

Finally, we use functions from the **kableExtra** package to add our top header row.

```{r}
kable(
  tab_01,
  col.names = c("Measure", "*M*", "*SD*", "*M*", "*SD*"),
  align = c("l", "c", "c", "c", "c"),
  digits = 2,
  caption = "Means and Standard Deviations of Three Measures of Graduate Programs of Education ($n=122$)"
  ) %>%
  add_header_above(
    header = c(" " = 1, "Untransformed" = 2, "Log-transformed" = 2)
    ) %>%
  footnote(
    general = "Variables were log-transformed using the natural logarithm.",
    general_title = "Note.",
    footnote_as_chunk = TRUE
    )
```


## Correlation Table

For our second example, say we wanted to produce a table of pairwise correlations for the variables: `peer`, `doc_accept`, and `enroll`. To begin we will again set up a data frame, but this time we will generate it using functions from the **corrr** package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
tab_02 = educ %>%
  select(peer, doc_accept, enroll) %>%
  correlate() %>%
  shave(upper = TRUE) %>%
  fashion(decimals = 2, na_print = "—") 

tab_02
```

```
     rowname peer doc_accept enroll
1       peer    —          —      —
2 doc_accept -.54          —      —
3     enroll  .10       -.03      —
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
tab_02 = educ %>%
  select(peer, doc_accept, enroll) %>%
  correlate() %>%
  shave(upper = TRUE) %>%
  fashion(decimals = 2, na_print = "—") 
```

Now we change the values in the `rownames` column by mutating in new values, and pipe this into the `kable()` function, where we will change the column name and add a caption. Keeping the default alignment will align the decimal points within columns. 


```{r}
tab_02 %>%
  mutate(
    rowname = c("1. Peer rating", "2. Ph.D. acceptance rate", "3. Enrollment")
  ) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Correlations between Three Measures of Graduate Programs of Education",
    col.names = c("Measure", "1", "2", "3")
  )
```


## Regression Table: Single Model

It is common to report the coefficient-level information from a fitted regression model in a table. The nice thing about using the `tidy()` function to obtain coefficient-level information from a fitted model is that the output is formatted as a data frame. Thus, we can use the output from `tidy()` directly in the `kable()` function. Below I fit a regression model and then use piping to obtain the coefficient-level information and create the table.

```{r}
lm(peer ~ 1 + doc_accept + gre_verbal, data = educ) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable()
```

To format this, we might want to change the column names and round the numerical information to a better number of digits; typically *p*-values are rounded to three decimal places and coefficients, standard errors and *t*-values are rounded to two digits.

```{r}
lm(peer ~ 1 + doc_accept + gre_verbal, data = educ) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Coefficient-Level Estimates for a Model Fitted to Estimate Variation in Peer Ratings.",
    col.names = c("Predictor", "B", "SE", "t", "p"),
    digits = c(0, 2, 3, 2, 3)
  )
```

Last things to fix are the predictor names and the *p*-values. The rounding of the *p*-values has rendered them as zero. We can use the `pvalue()` function from the **scales** package to better format the column of *p*-values. This is carried out prior to piping the output into the `kable()` function by changing the values in the `p.value` column. (Note that rather than load a package for a single function we can specify the package directly prior to the function name using two colons; `scales::pvalue()`.) Similarly, we can change the names in the `term` column at the same time. Lastly, we note that the SEs were truncated when we rounded, so we fix that by increasing the number of digits displayed in that column. 


```{r}
lm(peer ~ 1 + doc_accept + gre_verbal, data = educ) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    p.value = scales::pvalue(p.value),
    term = c("Intercept", "Ph.D. acceptance rate", "Verbal GRE score")
  ) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Coefficient-Level Estimates for a Model Fitted to Estimate Variation in Peer Ratings.",
    col.names = c("Predictor", "B", "SE", "t", "p"),
    digits = c(0, 2, 3, 2, 3)
  )
```

One last tweak is that now in the column of *p*-values, the alignment of the decimal place is off (default alignment for text is left-aligned). We can fix this by changing the alignment to be right-aligned. This is useful for numeric values so that the decimal points within a column line up.

```{r}
lm(peer ~ 1 + doc_accept + gre_verbal, data = educ) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    p.value = scales::pvalue(p.value),
    term = c("Intercept", "Ph.D. acceptance rate", "Verbal GRE score")
  ) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Coefficient-Level Estimates for a Model Fitted to Estimate Variation in Peer Ratings.",
    col.names = c("Predictor", "B", "SE", "t", "p"),
    digits = c(0, 2, 3, 2, 3),
    align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r")
  )
```



## Regression Table: Multiple Models

There are several specific packages that help us create tables of regression results. The [Stargazer package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf), the [texreg package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/texreg/vignettes/texreg.pdf) and the [finalfit package](http://www.datasurg.net/2018/05/16/elegant-regression-results-tables-and-plots-the-finalfit-package/) are but a few of these.

I tend to use both the **texreg** package (more customizable) and the **stargazer** package (easier). Below I illustrate how to create a table of regression results using the **stargazer** package. First we fit a few models.

```{r}
# Fit candidate models
lm.1 = lm(peer ~ 1 + doc_accept, data = educ)
lm.2 = lm(peer ~ 1 + enroll, data = educ)
lm.3 = lm(peer ~ 1 + doc_accept + enroll, data = educ)
```

After loading the **stagazer** package, the `stargazer()` function can be used to create a basic table of regression results. The `type=` argument defaults to `latex`, so if you are rendering to an HTML document, you need to change this to `type="html"`.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(stargazer)

stargazer(lm.1, lm.2, lm.3, type = "html")
```

The function outputs raw HTML (or LaTeX), so to get it to form into a table you need to include `results='asis'` in your Rmarkdown chunk.

````
```{r message=FALSE, results='asis'} `r ''`
library(stargazer)

stargazer(lm.1, lm.2, lm.3, type = "html")
```
````

```{r message=FALSE, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
stargazer(lm.1, lm.2, lm.3, type = "html")
```

There are several arguments in the `stargazer()` function to customize the table.


```{r results='hide'}
stargazer(
  lm.1, lm.2, lm.3,
  type = "html",
  title = "Three Regression Models Predicting Variation in Peer Ratings",
  column.labels = c("Model A", "Model B", "Model C"),
  colnames = FALSE,
  model.numbers = FALSE,
  dep.var.caption = " ",
  dep.var.labels = "Peer rating (1-5 scale)",
  covariate.labels = c("Ph.D. acceptance rate", "Enrollment"),
  keep.stat = c("rsq", "f"),
  notes.align = "l",
  add.lines = list(c("Corrected AIC", round(AICc(lm.1), 1), round(AICc(lm.2), 1), round(AICc(lm.3), 1))),
  out = "images/table1.html"
  )
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
htmltools::includeHTML("images/table1.html")
```

There is a known bug with the stargazer table not printing the asterisks next to the significance values in the notes section of the table when outputting to HTML. The solution as [documented here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51883610/p-values-significance-not-showed-in-stargazer-html-regression-table) is to output the html code to an external file using the `out=` argument in `stargazer()` and then inserting that html code in a new code chunk via the `includeHTML()` function from the **htmltools** package.

The `add.lines=` argument adds a line to the bottom of the output. This argument takes a list that includes the name you want to output in the regression table and then the value to output for each of the models. Here we computed the corrected AIC value using the `AICc()` function from the **AICmodavg** package for each of the models. (Note: We will learn about this in the [More Information Criteria for Model Selection unit](#moreinfocrit).)
